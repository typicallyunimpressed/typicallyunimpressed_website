            <p>This Charleston dress may be my favorite Doen piece in my collection. Although this particular pattern is currently unavailable, the Charleston is a style that Doen brings back in different patterns and fabrics. Their Summer 2020 collection currently includes the Charleston dress in a colorful floral pattern on a cream/ivory backdrop. Based on their instagram account, I believe Doen will be adding two more Charleston dresses with the second chapter of their summer collection--a dark floral version (in the same pattern as the light floral currently available) and a white/brown buffalo plaid.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now that we've overcome the panic that this dress is discontinued, let's gush over this piece. The style of this dress reminds me a lot of the Catskill, but the fabric is much more lightweight and suitable for casual wear. The sleeves are long but are easily rolled up, which gives the dress a more effortless look. The dress is unlined but does not require a slip.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The neckline is plunging but covers what needs to be covered. One of my other Charleston dresses actually came with a hook and eye closure that I thought was a brilliant feature. However, since this dress is an XS (that was all that was available on their website), there isn't much room for me to add a closure. The benefit of the dress being on the snug size is that my chest feels well covered and supported. I actually ended up finding this exact dress in a S as well and although I am glad to have it, the chest area balloons out a bit and does not "cup" me as well.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As with the Catskill dress, there are no zip or button closures--It must be pulled over the head. I sized up to a M in the Catskill for this reason so I was worried about getting the XS in the Charleston but it works for me! I do have to tug a *bit* more, but I feel less worried about the fabric on the Charleston anyway. As I mentioned with the Catskill, it's difficult to avoid rubbing your face on the neckline of the dress when taking it off, but I just try to take my time. The pattern on the dress would effectively conceal any marks or stains from makeup/skincare anyway.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The tie-waist allows you to then cinch in the waist to your preference, and the skirt flows out *perfectly*. The cut of the skirt component of Doen's dresses is very hard to come by, in my opinion. It feels vintage but modern, elegant, simple and timeless.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you happen to find this Hardwick Garden Floral pattern anywhere, snag it up! Doen also made their "Plum Top" in this pattern so that's an alternative if you loved the fabric but not the dress. This floral pattern is just magical. Unlike the Green Valley Floral of the Catskill dress, which I find more earthy, warm and grounded, I associate the Hardwick Garden Floral pattern with pastels, air, whimsy and fairies.</p>
