            <p>First, if you think you might be interested in this Sezane Nalla Skirt, go check to see if it is available on their website, like..right now. It seems that Sezane is down to their last few pieces so you might be able to catch one in stock, especially if you're on their site or app at 3:30 AM (9AM Paris time) on Wednesday or Sunday--that is when they restock their website. If it's not in stock, keep an eye out for future collections. Sezane tends to bring back popular items in new patterns/fabrics. They've brought back my favorite Jeanne dress (twice!) in new prints/fabrics so I wouldn't be surprised if the Nalla skirt makes a comeback.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now--do you need the Sezane Nalla skirt? I'll tell you my reasoning behind this purchase. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In general, I think midi skirts and midi dresses are one of the best cost-effective items you can buy. Unlike shorter pieces, you can transition midi skirts/dresses into colder seasons, they are forgiving to your body and degree of hair growth and they suit almost any occasion (relaxed, office, or conservative...casual or more dressed up). My boyfriend and I lay out in a park every Friday after work and I always opt for midi pieces because I dont have to worry about what is on show and they also protect me from bugs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So I'm always on the look out for midi skirts and dresses, knowing that I get a ton of wear out of them. This skirt caught my eye primarily because of gorgeous, unique print/pattern. It's is one of the sweetest, dainty-est patterns I have ever seen. Up close, you can see the beautiful, tiny multi-color flowers but from a distance it looks like a subtle confetti print that reminds me of sprinkle frosting every time I wear it. Because of its subtle multi-color pattern, you can pair this skirt with virtually any color top, which assured me even more that I would get a ton of wear out of it. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Another thing I keep in mind with respect to patterns and versatility is how high-maintenance the fabric/pattern is. I have virtually no white bottoms in my wardrobe because I'm far too neurotic to wear something so vulnerable. Printed fabrics like this skirt are much more forgiving to the inevitable wear and tear of daily wearing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is also 100% silk with a very soft 100% viscose lining, which makes the skirt flow beautifully and keeps it extremely light weight (but not transparent). Finally, it has adorable cloth-covered,functional buttons down the side of the skirt that you can undo for a higher slit. You'll also use the buttons to get into the skirt, as there is no zip. I was also pleased that there was no zip closure because I find that zip closures on skirts can get a bit wonky with time since you're sitting on them--I've had this happen to at least 2 of my Reformation midi skirts. I prefer the button closure that remains intact and, worst case scenerio, can be easily fixed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Between the gorgeous, unique pattern, that honestly you'll never find again, and construction of this skirt, I knew it was going to be a fantastic addition to my wardrobe. It is pricey, but I knew this fabric would come by once in a lifetime. I look forward to wearing it every week and it attracts glimpses everywhere I go.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I intially purchased my usual size 4 in Sezane but found that the skirt fit a *bit* more fitted than I would prefer. If I gained any weight it would no longer fit--so I opted to order one size up. A general tip for sizing--consider the construction of the piece and how easily it could be altered. Because of the button closure, you could easily take in the waist of the skirt as needed and (in the future) release that extra fabric if you needed more room. I always prefer to give myself that wiggle room so that my pieces can accomodate by body for years to come.</p>
