            <p>This Catskill dress by Doen feels like a luxurious hug. It is 100% silk but does not have the sheen and typical appearance of silk. I have seem washed silk likened to suede. I don't find that comparison totally inaccurate. It is extremely soft with almost "fuzzy" feel against the skin, but there is no fur, it's just that soft.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The dress is unlined but does not require a slip. The neckline is plunging but does not feel too revealing, as it totally covers the breasts. If preferred, I don't believe it would be too difficult to alter the neckline to provide more coverage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are no zip or button closures on this dress. It must be pulled over the head, which is why I chose to size up to a medium (although I believe I could have made a small work as well). Even still, there is a moment of panic when changing into and out of this dress because you want to be gentle with the material (I avoid excessive tugging but I have no reason to believe the material is too delicate) and it is difficult to avoid rubbing the neckline against your face (to avoid makeup or skincare transfer). I just take it slow and do my best. The pattern on the dress would effectively conceal any marks or stains anyway.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The tie-waist allows you to then cinch in the waist to your preference, and the skirt flows out *perfectly*. The cut of the skirt component of Doen's dresses is very hard to come by, in my opinion. It feels vintage but modern, elegant, simple and timeless.</p>
